How to mount a NTFS partition for forensic investigations under Linux.
======================================================================



# Partition table

Read the partition table to identify the offset, where the partition you like to mount starts:

<pre>
$ fdisk -l imagefile.dd

Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

      Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
imagefile.dd            2048  3907029167  1953513560    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT
</pre>

The output of the fdisk command show us that the partition start at sector 2048. Each sector contains 1 block of 512 bytes.



# Mounting the partition

Now we know the offset. In the example above the offset is at sector 2048.
A sector has 512 bytes. We can mount the partition. The syntax is: `sudo mount -o options <imagefile> <mountpoint>`. You need to have root rights to mount, so you need sudo.

The image should be mounted for forensic investigations. There are some useful options which are explained below. The command to mound should look like:

<pre>
$ sudo mount -o ro,noload,loop,noexec,offset=$((512*2048)),show_sys_files,streams_interface=windows imagefile.dd /mnt/
</pre>



## Explanation of the options

**ro**  
    Open the image in read only mode to prevent modification of the evidence.

**noload**  
    Do not load the journal on mounting.

**loop**  
    Mount image as loopback device.

**noexec**  
    Prevent execution of binaries from the image to prevent infection of the forensic workstation.

**offset**  
    Offset where the partition starts, in bytes. Easy to calculate for the shell. Just use the fdisk output.

**show_sys_files**  
    Provides access to file system meta data. New files which are not accessible without this options are for example:
<pre>
	- $AttrDef
	- $Boot
	- $BadClus
	- $Extend
	- $LogFile
	- $UpCase
	- $MFTMirr
	- $Secure
	- $Bitmap
	- $Volume
</pre>

**streams_interface=windows**  
    Privides access to NTFS named data streams. So we can fetch information which was not accessible before, like:
<pre>
	$ cat /Users/username/Downloads/Dropbox.exe:Zone.Identifier
	[ZoneTransfer]
	ZoneId=3
</pre>
